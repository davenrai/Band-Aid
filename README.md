Our is app is Band-Aid. It matches musical performers (Performer) with the venues (Venue) looking to hire them for a show (Booking)

Once the instructions below are carried out to install the app, you can use it by typing http://localhost:5000 in Chrome. You will be at the main page for our application, "Band-Aid." Initially you must signup as either a Performer or a Venue. Passwords must be 6 characters in length.  Upon subsequent log-ins, this immediately takes you to your Venue or Performer dashboard. There is also an admin login, which can be accessed with username "admin1" and password "admin1."
