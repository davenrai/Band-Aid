To start our app, please go to the index.html file. This is the main page for our application, "Band-Aid." To log in, press log in and use "user" as both the password and the username. This immediately takes you to our request timeline. Currently, you can add a request to our timeline and it will add it. 

At the top, there is a button that says "My Profile." This will take you to a standard profile page (for now), but later users will be able to create their own profiles! You can use the log out button at the top to log out of our application.

Next, you can sign up. You can pick a username, password, and say which email you need. Right now, you can add anything. You also have the option to pick if you are restaurant or performer. 

Once you sign up, you can add in details about yourself to create a profile. 

Lastly, there is admin log in. Use "admin" for both the username and password. The admin will have several functionalities in the future, such as deleting users and requests, changing passwords, and changing the details of events on the mass timeline.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
